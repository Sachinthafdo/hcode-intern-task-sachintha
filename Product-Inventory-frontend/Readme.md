## Setup

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The application should now be running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

---

## Types

The application uses TypeScript for type safety and consistency. All type definitions are located in the src/types.ts file.

2. **Products**: The main container for handling the state of products, form submission, and search functionality.
3. **ProductForm**: A form for adding and editing products.
4. **ProductsTable**: A table displaying the list of products with options to edit and delete.
5. **Header**: A header component containing the search bar and filter options.

## NPM Scripts

Here are the available npm scripts to streamline your development process:

- **Start the development server:**

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  This runs the app in development mode on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

- **Build the production version:**

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  Generates an optimized production build in the `build/` folder.

- **Lint TypeScript files:**

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

  Runs ESLint to analyze code and highlight any syntax or code style issues.

- **Preview production build locally:**
  ```bash
  npm run preview
  ```
  Serves the production build on a local server to test the deployment-ready app.

## Usage

- **Adding Products**: Fill out the form and submit it to add a product to the inventory.
- **Editing Products**: Click the **pencil icon** (‚úèÔ∏è) next to a product to load its details into the form for editing.
- **Deleting Products**: Click the **bin icon** (üóëÔ∏è) next to a product to remove it from the inventory.
- **Pagination**: Navigate between pages using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

Ensure the backend server is running to handle requests for products, categories, and filtering. The API endpoints are defined in the `src/pages/Products/index.tsx` file under the `BASE_URL` constant. By default, it is set to `http://localhost:8081`. If you're using a different backend setup, please update the `BASE_URL` to match your server's address.
